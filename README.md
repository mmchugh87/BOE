# UK GDP Dashboard
##### Coding Assessment April 2024

The goal of this GitHub repository is to generate an interactive dashboard, with which to monitor the evolution over time of UK GDP and some of its key components.
The dashboard is generated from a python script ("BOE_Dash.py") and makes heavy use of python libraries "Dash" and "Plotly".
The live dashboard can be accessed online, here:
**https://mmchugh87-github-io.onrender.com/**
(Note: this dashboard is rendered via a free online service called "render.com". Given "render.com" is a free service, the page can be slow to load - please be patient if this is the case. It may become necessary to "refresh" the page after waiting a couple of minutes).
